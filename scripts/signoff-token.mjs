/**
 * The identifier a breaking-change signoff names.
 *
 * Pinning a signoff to the head commit meant every push voided it, so a lint fix or a review
 * tweak cost a fresh signoff while changing nothing about the release. That trains people to
 * rubber-stamp the gate, and it is stricter than this repo's own review policy, which keeps
 * approvals across pushes (`dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push: false`).
 *
 * Keyed on the changesets this PR adds, edits, renames or removes since `base` (the merge-base), plus
 * `.changeset/config.json` at head and the resulting version. Keying on every changeset at head
 * voided the signoff whenever main was merged in, because main brings other PRs' changesets.
 * Every changeset this PR touches counts, not only the ones declaring major: any changeset edit
 * can move the release, and erring toward asking again is the safe direction. Blob ids come from
 * git, so the hash changes if and only if the content does. Renaming a changeset re-triggers,
 * which is correct: Changesets reads it by path.
 *
 * `config.json` is read from the head commit, not the working tree: the preview job restores
 * main's copy before running, but after the merge this PR's copy is the one that governs.
 *
 * 16 hex characters (64 bits). The signoff names this value, so a collaborator who wanted a
 * different release to inherit an existing signoff would have to grind a second preimage against
 * it; 64 bits puts that out of reach, where a short prefix would not.
 *
 * Lives in its own module so the gate's suite can exercise it against real git trees. Testing it
 * through `preview-release.mjs` would mean standing up Changesets and a workspace first, which is
 * how it previously shipped covered only by assertions about the workflow's text.
