/**
 * The identifier a breaking-change signoff names.
 *
 * Pinning a signoff to the head commit meant every push voided it, so a lint fix or a review
 * tweak cost a fresh signoff while changing nothing about the release. That trains people to
 * rubber-stamp the gate, and it is stricter than this repo's own review policy, which keeps
 * approvals across pushes (`dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push: false`).
 *
 * Keyed on every changeset at head plus the resulting version, deliberately wider than "only the
 * changesets declaring major": any changeset edit can move the release, and erring toward asking
 * again is the safe direction. Blob ids come from git, so the hash changes if and only if the
 * content does. Renaming a changeset re-triggers, which is correct: Changesets reads it by path.
 *
 * 16 hex characters (64 bits). The signoff names this value, so a collaborator who wanted a
 * different release to inherit an existing signoff would have to grind a second preimage against
 * it; 64 bits puts that out of reach, where a short prefix would not.
 *
 * Lives in its own module so the gate's suite can exercise it against real git trees. Testing it
 * through `preview-release.mjs` would mean standing up Changesets and a workspace first, which is
 * how it previously shipped covered only by assertions about the workflow's text.
